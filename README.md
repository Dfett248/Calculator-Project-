# Calculator-Project-
a simple calculator made in VScode.
The function of this calculator is that it adds/subtracts/multiplies/divides two numbers. I utilized VScode with knowledge from pythonlearning.org & error searching on perplexity AI to write/better understand errors of my code from initial writing to final code. I realized that my main errror was trying to make my original code too complex & my incorrect, inconsistent syntax/indentation at times, which helped me learn more about the importance of syntax & planning beforehand.
Final note about this project: this was my 1st real coding project (done without a tutorial or any real guidance).
