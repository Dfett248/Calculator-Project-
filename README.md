# Calculator-Project-
a simple calculator made in VScode 
function of this calculator: adds/subtracts/multiplies/divides two numbers, utilized VScode with pythonlearning.org & perplexity AI to write my code from initial writing to final code, tried to make my original code too complex & had incorrect syntax/indentation at times, learned more about the importance of syntax & planning beforehand
note about this project: my 1st real coding project (done without a tutorial or any real guidance)
